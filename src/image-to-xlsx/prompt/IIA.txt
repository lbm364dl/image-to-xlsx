I have a CSV where the comma is the separator. It has three columns, the first two being numeric, that must not be changed.
The third column contains text or numeric data, which you should try to fix. Some information that you need for that:
- Do not change anything from the structure of the data, keep each individual entry as it is. You should only ever change the content of each entry
- Assume text is in French and it may contain spelling mistakes, which you should try to fix
- Try to fix small spelling mistakes in numeric cells, e.g., if it looks like a number, an I is probably a 1, an O is probably a 0, a G is probably a 6, IO is probably 10, etc...
- There may be some entries that only have digits, so it should be a single number, but maybe a space appears between some digits. Remove the space and make it a single number
- The output should still be a valid CSV, that is, all rows must have the same number of columns. It must have three columns
- Only reply back with the corrected text. Do not include headers or anything, start directly with the first row
